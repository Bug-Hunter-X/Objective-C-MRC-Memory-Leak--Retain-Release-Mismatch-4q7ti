In Objective-C, a rare but impactful bug can arise from the misuse of the `retain` and `release` methods in manual reference counting (MRC).  Consider this scenario:

```objectivec
@interface MyClass : NSObject
@property (retain) NSString *myString;
@end

@implementation MyClass
- (void)dealloc {
    [myString release];
    [super dealloc];
}
@end

// ... in some other method ...
MyClass *obj = [[MyClass alloc] init];
obj.myString = [[NSString alloc] initWithString: "Hello"];
[obj release]; // This releases the object, but not the string!
```

The problem here is that even though `obj` is released, the `myString` property still retains a strong reference to the `NSString` object.  Because `[obj release]` doesn't release the string, this leads to a memory leak.  The `dealloc` method of `MyClass` will eventually get called and release the string, but only after `obj` is already gone, leading to a potential double-release in the case of the string.

This type of bug is subtle because it doesn't immediately crash.  Instead, it slowly consumes memory, potentially leading to performance degradation or even crashes down the line.
